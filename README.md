In this personal project I am practicing Algorithms, C programming language, and using github as the primary version control and project management system.

Workbook for "Algorithmic Thinking" by Daniel Zingaro.

This book is a hands on exploration of the most common algorithyms used today. It does this through the use of coding contest questions and builds the use of the algorithym from the ground up with iteration. We start each problem by breaking it down into simpler and simlar problems we can easily solve. Using that logic we build it up until we realize a specific algorithm that already exists would be the perfect solution.

Additionally it uses the C coding language. C is a lower level language which means you have to directly control aspects like memory and compiling that higher level languages(python) manage automatically. That is why each group of code had input and output files. The compilier is separate from the language so you have to manually take what you've written and input it to see the output.
